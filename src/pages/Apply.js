                <p>Applications begin 1st September and the 1st deadline is 15 January in the year before the programme commences, although it is possible to apply later than this if courses still have vacancies. Anyone applying after the 30 June by 18:00 will be automatically entered into ‘Clearing’. Clearing takes place after the publication of the A Level results in August when universities will have a clearer picture of how many offers have been accepted and therefore how many vacancies they may have.</p>
