                <p>This degree provides the a variety of business skills required for the workplace. We have consulted with prospective employers on the content and design of this course to ensure that the skills students learn are industry-standard.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The first year of the course provides you with a grounding in a variety of business disciplines, which underpin later learning. In year two you have optional modules providing you with the opportunity to tailor your degree. In the final year, a 30 credit Major Project on a topic of your choice allows for further individual specialisation.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Case studies will be used for you to apply your skills in analysis and problem solving. In some cases you will justify and reflect upon your business decisions and strategies to a panel of academic and industry experts in a ‘Dragon’s Den’ style scenario, or a group presentation made in the form of a pitch to your peers and lecturers.</p>
