                <p>Are you passionate about literature? Are you always reading books, thinking about books and talking about books? Are you an imaginative and creative person, and do you want to work in a career that draws on these talents? If so, our English Literature degree might be the course just for you.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>In your first year, you will be introduced to the key skills that have traditionally underpinned literary criticism (such as genre analysis, textual analysis, and writing for audiences), as well as those that are more akin to the publisher of today.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>In your second year you will build on this knowledge base with a set of modules that draw on and challenge the literary canon. A wide range of texts are selected to broaden your knowledge of literary movements and encourage you to become creative, critical, free thinkers.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>In your final year you will undertake a dissertation project that will let you explore a topic of your choice. Students have proposed a wide range of topics in the past, from the vegetarian utopia of Shelley, via mental health, femininity and the supernatural in gothic fiction; representations of ‘The Oriental’ in Tintin; the links between hip-hop and poetry, through to dragons and their symbolic resonance in the fantasy genre.</p>
